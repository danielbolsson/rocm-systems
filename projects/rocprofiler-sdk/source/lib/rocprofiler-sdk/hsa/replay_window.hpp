// Primitives shared by the replay mechanisms that re-execute recorded GPU work: the per-agent
// serialization lock, the drain helpers a replay window needs before it snapshots device memory,
// and the queue submission path used to re-submit recorded packets.
//
// Kernel replay (single dispatch, driven from inside WriteInterceptor) and range replay (a recorded
// sequence, driven from rocprofiler_range_replay_end) must agree on all of these: they share one
// lock per agent, and both must exclude the same concurrent GPU work from their snapshot->restore
// windows.

// Per-agent replay serialization (reader/writer). A replay's snapshot->restore window must exclude
// any concurrent GPU work on the agent that could mutate tracked device memory, but ordinary
// dispatches do not conflict with one another. So this is a shared_mutex:
//   * a replay window takes the UNIQUE (writer) lock for the whole drain->snap->passes->restore
//     sequence, excluding all other replays and every non-replay dispatch on the agent;
//   * a non-replay dispatch takes the SHARED (reader) lock across its submit, so many normal
//     dispatches still run concurrently while a pending replay writer waits for in-flight submits
//     to finish and blocks new ones from entering the window.
// Different agents use different mutexes and run concurrently; combined with agent-scoped snapshots
// this keeps multi-GPU replay isolated. The reader lock only bounds *submission*; the async GPU
// tail is drained by the replay window before it snapshots.

// ~60s) drain. Instead poll each queue's in-flight async count under a brief read lock and sleep
// between polls, so the map lock is held only for the microsecond poll -- never across the wait.
// Safe against concurrent queue destruction: a Queue is only dereferenced while the read lock is
// held (destroy_queue erases under the write lock), and the live set is re-read every poll. The
